<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renewable Diesel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>From Lipids</li><li>From Cellulosic Biomass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The renewable diesel market consists of two primary types based on feedstock: from lipids and from cellulosic biomass. Renewable diesel from lipids is produced through the hydroprocessing of fats and oils, offering a direct substitute for petroleum diesel, with high compatibility for existing infrastructure. In contrast, renewable diesel from cellulosic biomass involves converting non-edible plant materials into fuel, often through advanced processes like gasification or fermentation, promoting waste reduction and land conservation while expanding feedstock diversity.</p></p>
