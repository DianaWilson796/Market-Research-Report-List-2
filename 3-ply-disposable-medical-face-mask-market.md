<p><ul><li>Woven Cloth</li><li>Non-Woven</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3-Ply Disposable Medical Face Mask market primarily comprises two types: woven cloth and non-woven materials. Woven cloth masks are made from interlaced fibers, providing durability and a certain level of breathability. However, they may not offer the same filtration efficiency as non-woven masks.
